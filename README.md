# Introduction to Computational Robotics: Computer Vision Project

Authors: [Dexter Friis-Hecht](https://github.com/dfriishecht) & Mo Ampane

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to use computer vision to recognize various hand signals to control a finite state machine using ROS2 in Python.

## External Libraries

Mediapipe, photo collection file, opencv, etc.

## Data Collection and Processing

Add picture of normal hand mesh, then normalized hand mesh.

## Training The Classifier

Talk about going from random forest classifier to neural network?

## ROS2 Integration

Image message to opencv image

## Behavior Implementation

Add gifs of behaviors

## Challenges

Location of camera, range of hand detection from camera...

## Stretch Goals

## Learnings
