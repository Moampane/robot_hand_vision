# robot_hand_vision
Computer vision project for Computational Robotics class. 

## Project Overview
Using Scikit-Learn and computer vision to recognize hand signals to control a finite state machine. 

## External Libraries
Mediapipe, photo collection file, opencv, etc.

## Data Collection and Processing
Add picture of normal hand mesh, then normalized hand mesh.

## Training The Classifier
Talk about going from random forest classifier to neural network?

## ROS2 Integration
Image message to opencv image

## Behavior Implementation
Add gifs of behaviors

## Challenges
Location of camera, range of hand detection from camera...

## Stretch Goals

## Learnings
